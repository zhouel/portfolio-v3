							With various social networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, our second, and third connections link us to millions of professionals. However, there's very little understanding of how these groups of people might be connected. SixDegree is a conceptual tool that helps job seekers and recruiters alike to gain context and insight into one's aggregated networks.

					<p>Six Degree is composed of two parts: a job seeker platform and a recruiter platform. Both aggregate one's social networks and aim to help people organize their socio-professional network in an insightful and meaningful way. Whether you're loooking for a summer internship or reaching out to a potential new hire, knowing who knows who is important.</p>

					<p>
						Interviews with students revealed that sometimes landing a job requires reaching out to a brother's ex-roommate or a mentor's other mentee. Sociologist Mark Granovetter's research also asserts that <a href='https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf'>less direct, second and third degree relationships are most effective in opening new opportunities</a>. In fact, many of the students we talked to were cognizant of this fact. Unfortunately, there's no way to discover distant, but efficacious relationships without manually crawling through contact lists or relying on luck. SixDegree aimed to weight and relationps to help people find distant degree connections with a strong relationship path.

					<p>
						Networking is a two-sided coin, and our interviews revealed that recruiters have similar problems for slightly different reasons. Recruiters currently suffer low yield, scattering their time across various sources. Follow-up and follow-through are the most difficult components of recruiting, so SixDegree aimed to improve on  recruiter-candidate communication channels.
