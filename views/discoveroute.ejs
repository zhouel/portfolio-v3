							As citizens of the smartphone era, we use our mobile maps to get everywhere. However, traveling from point A to point B doesn't take in account the needs of busy people with multiple stops or adventurers with time to spare. We set out to help people with two goals: find new, interesting <em>places along a path</em> and with <em>time efficiency</em>.

					<p>Discoveroute provides time- and route-constrainted local business search. Whether you need a coffee rush while on your way to work, or you and a friend want to meet halfway at a bar or restaurant, the mobile web app shows the visual mapping of these places and ensures you make your final destination on time.

					<hr class='indent' /><h5>Needfinding </h5>
					<p>Oftentimes, traveling ends up more about getting to the final destination than about the actual journey. While observing people planning trips, we learned that finding new or convenient places is a major hassle. Current maps don't take into account areas between routes or extraneous travel time.

					<p>The process began with a <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/11eNJOrABNe7P4Xs9IKNGPyz6dUSsuQMSZ5wvuiUBW80/edit?usp=sharing'>few</a> <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z_q_SwTqsinrGJ1TNQXWabihAjNLDqWnKBmyyFbn070/edit?usp=sharing'>different</a> <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAIzg-hUR5z3vHOmQqJj79KRR4lu2jXnr57k1eWL4YY/edit?usp=sharing'>ideas</a> prototyped in parallel. By starting with paper prototypes, we were able to conduct '<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment'>wizard of oz experiments</a>' to see which components met the users' needs and which didn't.

					<p>One of the main takeaways from the heuristic walkthroughs was that the navigation needed much more refinement. We iterated on potential flows with rough UI mockups. Throughout, our focus was for the interaction to be straightforward but also allow for non-linearity. We tested these models, and once we finalized the navigation, created high-fidelity mockups.</p>

					<hr class='indent' /><h5>User Testing</h5>
					<p>After multiple iterations of a functional product, we began user testing with a combination of cognitive walkthroughs and online tests. We started off by following a <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1L0jkwwLmKdiEOPClTPE6Aj004j0z8gdkn3lhZjFXA/edit#bookmark=id.rizcytbtr6h'>usability script</a> we wrote, but listed a number of activities and actions to look out for.</p>

					<p>One major issue we investigated was in selecting categories. It was unclear that multiple categories could be selected, and very few people attempted to. In <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1L0jkwwLmKdiEOPClTPE6Aj004j0z8gdkn3lhZjFXA/edit#bookmark=id.c536mr1lj6zh'>redesigning</a> this part of the interaction, we narrowed it down to two to run an A/B test on. After running an online A/B test, we confirmed our <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1L0jkwwLmKdiEOPClTPE6Aj004j0z8gdkn3lhZjFXA/edit#'>test results</a> with cognitive walkthroughs. The monochrome version was incorporated into the final design, since it had clearer actions and resulted in less button mashing.
